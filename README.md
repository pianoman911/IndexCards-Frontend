This is the frontend for the poorly coded IndexCards app. But it works :)

## FAQ

#### Why is this project poorly coded?

The project simply consists of a few tests. The security design should not be adopted in any case. Also, this is my first try to create and **design** and it should be fast and efficient.

#### For whom is the project intended?

It's a simple school project.
